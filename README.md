# Project 2: Hypothesis Testing & Bayes Net

Contributors: Andrew Hoang & Dhilan Panjabi

A collaborative CS2810 mini project focused on designing original probability and statistics problems with full solutions. Includes a chi-squared hypothesis testing problem based on real-world data and a 4-node Bayesian Network with joint distributions and inference questions, implemented in a Jupyter/Google Colab notebook to demonstrate statistical reasoning and probabilistic modeling.
